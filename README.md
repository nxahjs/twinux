# twinux
#### twinux is an Electron based Twitter client for Linux (Twi - nux... or is it tw - inux?)

<br>
I started making twinux when I found out there weren't many Twitter clients for Linux available.
<br>
I mean, come on! Twitter is one of the most popular social media networks out there and we're being forced to use a web browser!?
<br>
So I decided to build twinux. A very simple application that I hope you all enjoy.
<br><br>
### Building
<br>
Of course, just downloading the release files is the simplest way to do this, but if for some reason (e.g. I haven't made a build for your disto) it's very easy to build yourself. (Note: This does NOT install it. This runs it)
<br>
#### Steps:
1. Download Node.js and npm
2. Download twinux source code
3. Open the source code in cmd or terminal
4. Run the command `npm start`
**That's it! You should have successfully launched twinux!**
